## If you've decided to join:

1. Fork this repo and commit to the [Log](log.md).

2. **Code minimum an hour every day for the next 30 days.**

3. **Encourage at least two other people in the challenge on Twitter every day! Pay it forward!**

4. Change the date in [Rules](rules.md) to the day you've started the challenge.

5. **Tweet/Share your progress every day using the #30DaysOfX and #fnplus hashtag.**

6. Follow [100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/_100DaysOfCode) Twitter Bot that retweets the tweets that contain the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.

7. Important: (see No.3 above for a specific rule on this) Encourage others who are doing the same challenge on Twitter or elsewhere - by giving them props when they are posting updates on their progress, supporting them when things get difficult. Thus we will grow a community that is helpful and effective, which will lead to a higher success rate for each person involved. It's also more likely that you will stick to your own commitment, given that you will get acquainted with a couple people (or more) right away.

8. If you find a great, helpful resource that others would benefit from, either submit a Pull Request to add it to the repo, or just tweet at me (see info below)
